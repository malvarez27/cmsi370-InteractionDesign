| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Web Service Functions (_3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 3 API calls seen, all generally implemented correctly. But the shelter.find API call does accept a location (zip code), meaning that the search did not have to be restricted to the South Bay. Sounds straightforward enough—why wasn’t this included? | 43 | Including location seems straightforward |
| **Web App Layout (_2b_, _3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Pleasant, straightforward layout. Accordion sections containing a single button hurt efficiency though. From a UI point of view, the retrieval of dog breeds could have been built into the page and turned into a drop-down list for searching for a dog to adopt. This would have avoided the warning that the breed name had to be spelled correctly. | 25 | Better to use breed search as a dropdown |
| **Test Suite (_4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 6 failures out of 6 tests —mostly undefined errors, many having to do with an undefined request (i.e., meaning that Jasmine Ajax did not capture a network request)<br><br>**Statements** 20/50 (40.00%)<br>**Branches** 0/2 (0.00%)<br>**Functions** 0/3 (0.00%)<br>**Lines** 20/49 (40.82%) | 8 | Low number of tests, low coverage, low success rate
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | 4 errors, all due to undefined variables (they are defined elsewhere, but not in scope at the point where the error was reported) | -2 |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 12 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | met original due date |  |  |
|  |  | **74** | **Total** |
